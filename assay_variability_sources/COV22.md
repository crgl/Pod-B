Output for COV22
- Qualitative Result (Positive or Negative): are SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies present?
- Quantitative Result (AU/mL): if positive, how many antibodies? (in arbitary units)

Sources of Variability for COV22
- Participant's immune history (signal)
- Time after vaccination or infection (signal)
- Medical condition of participant (are they immunocompromised?) (signal)
- Whether it is run on serum or plasma (maybe?) (noise)
- How soon after collection the sample is run (noise)
- Lot of reagents used in assay (noise)
- Machine variability (noise)
