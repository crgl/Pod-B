# Errors/Variablity in saliva collection
This is called Markdown Neko for when you're googling to find the answer later

Now onward to the actual assignment. The variablity in saliva collection and data entry can come from a few types of occurances:
- Direction for how to drool
- Saliva volume collected(MARS cohorts spcifically)
- Consistency of the saliva
- How the sample is aliquoted

## How to Drool
In clinic we instruct all of our participants to spit/drool in the soy sauce cups until it covers the bottom of the cup. This creates a layer of variability because it depends on the perspective of the coordinator to determine what covering the bottom means. Therfore, standardizing the method of collection can reduce variablity at collection.
## Saliva Volume
This layer of variablity connects to the previoulsy mentioned one since the lack of a standardized method of collection lead to different volumes being collected at each visit. However, this section focusese on a specific cohort that consistently lacks enough saliva volume. Saliva samples collected from the MARS cohort rarely have enough volume to be aliquoted. Since kits are placed in the blood collection rooms and treament rooms, collection is left to the nurse and this increases the chances of samples lacking the correct volume. When analyzing data it may skew resutls to believe that the MARS participants do not produce enough saliva or any other weird interpretation.
## Consistency of the saliva
When aliquoting a saliva specimen, you may come across different consistencies. I believe it is harder to determine the correct volume of samples that are more viscous because they're more difficult to pull into the pipet. Viscosity is an area that may present variablity.
## How samples are aliquoted
We get samples of differring volumes from participants and when its time aliquot these samples each individual may do this a differnt way. For example, a sample may have 1.5 mL of Saliva but how a individual distributes this volume may be different. One person may put 1 mL in one tube and .5 mL in the next and other may do it a different way. Lots of rom for variability.
