# COVIG

## **Output for COVIG**
- **Qualitative Result (Positive or Negative)**: Determines whether IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 are present.
- **Quantitative Result (AU/mL)**: If positive, measures the concentration of IgG antibodies in arbitrary units (AU/mL).

## **Sources of Variability for COVIG**
- **Participant’s immune history** (signal)
- **Time after vaccination or infection** (signal)
- **Medical condition of participant (e.g., immunocompromised, malignancy)** (signal)
- **Sample type (serum vs. plasma)** (possible noise)
- **Time from collection to analysis** (noise)
- **Operator handling the test** (noise)

## **Signal vs. Noise and Ways to Control Variability**
### **Signal (biological variability we aim to measure)**
- Participant’s immune history
- Time after vaccination/infection
- Medical condition of participant
- **Control Strategy:** Ensure proper study design to interpret results correctly.

### **Noise (unwanted variability in the test results)**
- **Sample type (serum vs. plasma)**
  - **Control Strategy:** Standardize sample processing conditions.
- **Time from collection to analysis**
  - **Control Strategy:** Store samples under controlled conditions; process within a set timeframe after collection.
- **Operator handling**
  - **Control Strategy:** Implement SOPs to reduce human-induced variability.
